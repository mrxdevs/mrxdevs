# 👋 Hey, I'm **Amjad Ali** — also known as **MRX**

Most people introduce themselves with a job title.  
I prefer a *story*.

> **“MRX” isn’t just a name — it’s a state of mind.**  
> It means *I adapt, evolve, transform… without ever being restricted by a fixed identity.*

Just like `X` in mathematics,  
I am the **unknown**,  
the **variable**,  
the **one that fits wherever the system needs it**.

I build, break, rebuild, refactor, redesign — until it becomes the version that should have existed in the first place.

### 🌌 **My Aura: Infinite. Unbounded. Anonymous but Impactful.**  
I’m open to remain anonymous when needed —  
my work speaks louder than my face ever could.

---

# 🚀 What I Do

I architect and build **mobile ecosystems** — not just apps.  
My stack bends between **Flutter**, **Kotlin**, **Swift**, **WearOS**, **watchOS**, **BLE**, and **real-time systems**.

### 🛠️ When people ask “What do you build?”  
I say:

✔ Native + Hybrid Mobile Apps  
✔ WearOS & watchOS companions  
✔ BLE-powered automotive & healthcare systems  
✔ Real-time vehicle monitoring for premium EVs  
✔ Apps with 10K+ users & production uptime touching **99.9%**  
✔ CI/CD pipelines that ship lightning-fast  
✔ Cloud-backed scalable mobile architectures

# 🧬 The MrX Philosophy  
> **“If it doesn’t exist, I build it.  
> If it exists, I make it better.  
> If it’s good, I break it and rebuild it to perfection.”**

I am not tied to any identity —  
I am tied to purpose, precision, and progress.
